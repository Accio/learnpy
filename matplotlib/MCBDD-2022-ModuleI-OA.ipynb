    "### A probabilistic approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilistic approach follows the same line of logic as the integer approach, though we need some denotations and some help from the probability theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We let $I$ denote the event of *infection* and $H$ denote the event of non-infection (healthy). Then $p(I)$ indicates the probability that someone from a population, in our example the anxious Fred, is infected, and $p(H)$ indicates the probability that Fred is healthy. Let us assume that the matter of being infected or healthy is exclusive, namely anyone is either infected or healthy, in which case $p(I)+p(H)=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarily, $P$ indicates the probabily that Fred receives a positive test result and $N$ indicates the probability of a negative test result. Let us assume that two events are exclusive, namely a test is either positive or negative, then $p(P)+p(N)=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we can define the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $p(P|I)$ indicates the *conditional probability* of Fred receiving a positive test *given that* Fred is infected, which is the sensitivity of the test - 99% in our example above. \n",
    "    * What does the adjective *conditional* suggest? It suggests that knowing one event may change our belief of the porbability of another event. In this case, having known that Fred is infected, the probability that he receives a positive test result ($p(P|I)$) is way higher than the probability that Fred receives a positive test result if we do not know whether he is infected or not ($p(P)$). If you are not sure about this, use the integer approach to verify it.\n",
    "* $p(N|H)$ indicates the *conditional probability* of Fred receiving a negative test *given that* Fred is healthy, which is the specificity of the test - 99% in our example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We let $p(P,I)$ indicate the probability that someone is both infected and tested positive, which is known as a *joint probability* of two events. What is this probability? It is **not** $p(P) \\times p(I)$, because an infection and a positive test is definitely not independent from each other. Instead, we can think of the event that someone is both infected and tested positive as a two-step event: first, someone must be infected ($p(I)$); second, given that she is infected, she is tested positive ($p(P|I)$). Since both steps must happen, we have $p(P,I)=p(I)p(P|I)$, *i.e.* the probability of being infected ($p(I)$) multiplied by the probability of being positively tested given that the person is infected ($p(P|I)$). This is known as the *chain rule* of probability. The chain rule can be equivalently written as $p(P,I)=p(P|I)p(I)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also switch the two steps to arrive at $p(P,I)$: first, someone must be tested positive ($p(P)$); second, given that she is positively tested, she is infected ($p(I|P)$). Or equivalently, $p(P,I)=p(P)p(I|P)$. If you find this less intuitive, think of a quick test which is followed by an more accurate but laborious PCR test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having seen both ways to write $p(P,I)$, we reach an intriguing observation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(P)p(I|P)=p(I)p(P|I) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or equivalantly,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(I|P) = \\frac{p(I)p(P|I)}{p(P)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is known as the *Bayes theorem*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that any person that is being tested positive is either infected or healthy, we can write $p(P)=p(P,I)+p(P,H)=p(P|I)p(I)+p(P|H)p(H)$, or equivalently $p(P)=p(I|P)p(P)+p(H|P)p(P)$, using either the Bayes theorem, or by noting that $p(I|P)+p(H|p)=1$, which remains valid if we multiply both sides with $p(P)$. Given that the two forms are equivalent, we can choose a form that is more convenient for us to solve the problem at hand, as we will see below. And since both forms are equivalent with each other, we can call $p(P)$ a *marginal probability*, which sum up all subordinate *conditional probabilities*. Apparently a marginal probability can be written as sums (or integrals) of conditional probabilities in more than one ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having gained the ability of writing down the marginal probability, we can rewrite the Bayes theorem as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(I|P) = \\frac{p(I)p(P|I)}{p(I)p(P|I)+p(H)p(P|H)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did we choose this form but not the alternative form, $p(P)p(I|P)+p(P)p(H|P)$, of $p(P)$? Because the information provided by the original question comes in the former form, as you can see now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the denotations above, we can translate the original question to solving $p(I|P)$, the probability of Fred being infected that he is tested positive. We now need to get values for each symbol on the right side of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The question states that 5% of the population is infected, namely $p(I)=0.05$ and $p(H)=0.95$;\n",
    "2. The sensitivity of the test is given by $p(P|I)=0.99$;\n",
    "3. We are only left with $p(P|H)$, *i.e.* the probability that a healthy person is tested positive, which we cannot get from the question directly. However, we notice that $p(P|H)+p(N|H)=1$, since any healthy individual is tested either positive or negative. Therefore, $p(P|H)=1-p(N|H)=1-0.99=0.01$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have everything that we need to calculate $p(I|P)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(I|P) = \\frac{p(I)p(P|I)}{p(I)p(P|I)+p(H)p(P|H)}\n",
    "        = \\frac{0.05 \\times 0.99}{0.05 \\times 0.99 + 0.95 \\times 0.01}\n",
    "        \\approx 0.84 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that when the sensitivity and specificity of the test is both 99\\%, and the probability of any invididual being infected is 5%, the probability that Fred is indeed infected is 84\\% given that he is positively tested. We reach the same conclusion as the integer approach above."
