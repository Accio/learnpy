A minimal example of the `doctest` module in Python
===

The example follows the [documentation of doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html). Run `make` to run the doctest.

The `doctest` module reminds me of the `examples` sessions in R manual pages, with the difference that it checks the output, and we can include errors and warnings.
